* Create a descriptive branch name for the change you are proposing.
* Push your changes in your local branch back to your remote GitHub repository.
* In GitHub, create a pull request from your branch against our upstream repository.
* Someone (not you) will check the change and either merge it (thus automatically updating the website) or add comments for further changes or a reason for rejection.
