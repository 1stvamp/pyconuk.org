                <p>Education is at the heart of the Python community, after all, Guido tells us that Python was created as a language for anyone to use.</p><p>Many teachers and young people are interested in using Python at school. As a result we're organising a set of activities for them and to help them integrate with the wider Python community.</p>
                <p>In summary, they are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Friday - Python for Teachers. We look forward to welcoming our teaching colleagues for a day of training, collaboration, resource writing and networking in a friendly yet fun environment where we aim to help teachers get the most out of Python. </li>
                    <li>Saturday - A Raspberry Jam where participants of all ages will get to play, code, learn and share all things programming in Python on a RaspberryPi and any other device we can get to work. We aim to run various workshops aimed at beginner Pythonistas throughout the day.</li>
