                <h3>Daniele Procida</h3>
<p>I am a simple person, and have never wanted much. In fact, the only thing I’ve ever really wanted is power. As Immanuel Kant actually did not say: Power without ideas is empty, ideas without power are useless. Although I have always been full of ideas, power has been more elusive - I confess to having been useless most of my life, until I discovered Python and its open-source communities.</p>
<p>Computing power is a a kind of power, but I’m talking about a much more interesting kind: power over other people.</p>
<p>This is a story about power and where it comes from. I’m interested in the balances and imbalances of power in our worlds of software development, how it moves around and where it goes. I want to know how it affects the people who have it, how they use it, and whether they even realise that they hold it.</p>
<p>I believe that it really matters to open-source communities, that it’s poorly understood, and that not understanding it can have harmful consequences for us.</p>
