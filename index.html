                    <h2>Pycon UK Returns!</h2>

                    <p>PyconUK, the community organised conference for the Python programming
                    language in the United Kingdom, returns on Friday 18th - Monday 21st
                    September 2015.</p>

                    <p>As last year, it will be held at the Coventry University Technology
                    Centre and include the usual smörgåsbord of talks, tutorials,
                    workshops and keynotes. As in previous years there will be the hugely
                    popular social events too: a conference meal, a charity social event
                    on Friday evening (in aid of Cancer Research UK) and the famous
                    corridor track.</p>

                    <p>For the fourth year in a row, there will be an education track - we
                    look forward to welcoming teaching colleagues and the young
                    Pythonistas of tomorrow. This time we will also be joined by
                    DjangoGirls and Trans*Code - both of whom will be providing Python
                    training for new members of our community.</p>

                    <p>We're also very excited to announce a new string to our bow: the
                    Scientific Python track for, er, Scientists who use Python. Be amazed
                    at how Python is helping us learn about and understand the world
                    around us.</p>

                    <p>Finally, this year's PyconUK will be tinged with sadness as we
                    inevitably remember John Pinner, our illustrious conference chair and
                    founder of PyconUK who recently lost his fight with cancer. Our
                    tribute to John will be to make this the best PyconUK yet - and that
                    can only happen with your support.</p>

                    <p>If you'd like to contribute, volunteer or help in any other way with
                    PyconUK (which is completely organised by volunteers) then get in
                    touch by replying to this email.</p>

                    <p>The call for papers and early bird tickets will be announced very soon!</p>
