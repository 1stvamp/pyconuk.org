### Chris Dent

Gabbi is a new Python-based tool for testing web APIs using an easy to write and read YAML-based format that allows tests to focus on HTTP requests and responses, not Python. It was developed to make it easier to learn and contribute to OpenStack APIs but can be used in any environment, even for testing services that don't use Python (if that's your thing).

The presentation will give an overview of why Gabbi exists and a live demonstration of its features.  Listeners will hopefully go home with a new and useful tool and an expanded perspective on ways to make tests for web APIs.

For a taste of what the presentation will provide this presentation will be an updated and generalized version of a talk given at the OpenStack Liberty Summit using these slides: http://redhat.slides.com/chdent/gabbi?token=EE3TApJU
