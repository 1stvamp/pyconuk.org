<h2>Merkel welcomes Obama with beer and sausage breakfast before G7 summit</h2>

<p>Accompanied by beer, sausages and men in lederhosen, Barack Obama received a
warm welcome to the Bavarian Alps from Angela Merkel on Sunday, before two days
of intensive G7 summit talks.</p>


<p>Alpine horns and locals in traditional dress greeted the US president as he
arrived in Krün, a village close to the G7 venue of Schloss Elmau, before the
two leaders sat down to a breakfast of the local sausage, weisswurst, a glass
of weissbier and pretzels.</p>

<p>Locals cheered as Obama saluted them with a “Grüss Gott” – a traditional
greeting – against a stunning backdrop of pine forests and snowcapped
mountains, telling them: “That was without question, the best Alpine horn
performance I’ve ever heard.”</p>

<h2>Philip Hammond rejects Tory MPs' demand for veto over EU laws</h2>

<p>Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has set the stage for a showdown with
a new group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs by dismissing their central demand to
assert the supremacy of parliament over the EU.</p>

<p>As the Labour leadership contender Liz Kendall accused David Cameron of
showing a profound lack of leadership over the EU, the foreign secretary said
it would be impossible to give parliament a unilateral veto over EU laws.</p>

<p>Hammond spoke out after a new group of Tory MPs, Conservatives for Britain,
said they would campaign for a no vote in the EU referendum unless parliament
was able to assert its supremacy over the EU. This would mean repealing the
legislation that paved the way for the UK to join the EEC in 1973, which
asserts the primacy of EU law.</p>
