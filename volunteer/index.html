                    <p>Pycon UK is a community conference, run by unpaid
                    volunteers. But we need your help! We'd love you to get
                    involved and join the fun!</p>
                    <p>You have four options each of which will require only
                    around two hours of your time over the duration of the
                    whole conference:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Session Chairs</strong> - responsible for
                        the smooth running of sessions. You will be given a
                        simple checklist of what to do. We expect you to chair
                        two one-hour sessions and we'll negotiate which ones
                        once the talk schedule is published.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stage Hands</strong> - put stuff up and
                        take stuff down! You'll be busiest on Thursday
                        evening, Friday Morning and Sunday afternoon. You'll
                        set out chairs, set up computers for workshops, put up
                        signs and make sure everything is in the right place
                        at the right time. We expect you to spend an hour of
                        your time on two separate days. You'll get a checklist
                        of stuff to move, setup, take down at certain times
                        per day.</li>
                        <li><strong>Meeters and Greeters</strong> - be a
                        "people person". Spend an hour on two separate days
                        manning registration and/or being posted at busy
                        footfall points where you'll be expected to answer
                        questions, give directions and manage traffic
                        flow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Workshop Wizards</strong> - may the source
                        be with you! Spend two hours in one of the education
                        track workshops such as DjangoGirls, TransCode,
                        Teacher training or the kids day.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>What do you get out of this? A funky special edition
                    volunteer's t-shirt and a reduced rate ticket! But hurry,
                    there are only a limited number of tickets available.</p>
