        <h3 id="lightningtalks"></a>The Lightning Talk Show</h3>
        <p>Lightning Talks are speeches limited to 5
        minutes, covering any topic.</p>

        <p>The Lightning Talk Man orchestrates the proceedings. He
        ensures that timing is kept and links the talks with his own
        stories. That way he keeps the audience attentive, forms the
        aesthetics and promotes the speakers.</p>

        <p>From Stuttgart, Germany, Harald Armin Massa has been the MC of
        the PyCon UK lightning talks since PyCon UK hosted Europython
        in 2009 and 2010 and we decided we like him so much that we
        had to keep him.</p>

        <h3 id="panel">The PyCon UK Panel</h3>

        <p>In the style of Question Time (or Gardeners' Question Time,
        but without the plants), PyCon UK's acting Chair Zeth chairs a
        panel of five Python experts who try to answer your questions
        about the future of Python, Software development and the
        meaning of life, the universe and everything.</p>
        <p>The PyCon UK panel often includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Michael Foord: Python core developer and Go
          programmer. Works for Canonical, knows more than is healthy
            about Python testing and Cloud computing.</li>
          <li>Sarah Mount: Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at the
          University of Wolverhampton. Loves to talk about distributed
            Python and concurrency.</li>
          <li>Van Lindberg is a smiley chap and Vice President of
          Intellectual Property at Rackspace and chairman of the
          PSF.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Python for Science</h2>

        <p>The Python for Science events will be published in the run
        up to the conference.</p>
        
        <h2>Workshops</h2>

        <p>While the talks have a common 30 minute format, PyCon UK
        Workshops take many varied forms such as a longer 'hands on'
        tutorial or a chance for collaboration in a loosely led, group
        discussion.</p>
        
        <h3>The PyCon UK Job Fair</h3>
        <p>Get recruited by one of our sponsors! Dozens of people have
        gotten jobs because of connections made at PyCon UK, although
        sometimes in the corridor or socials! Come and meet our
        sponsor companies and also meet with fellow Python developers
        for tips on the all important Python Job Market.</p>

        <h3>Alternative Introduction to Python</h3>
        <p>Learn to love the Python Dictionary and then use it to
        understand Object Orientation, Modules, the Standard
        Library and more.</p>

        <h3>Single Board Computer Hackspace</h3>
        <p>Time to get tangible and share what you have made with your
        Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Beagle Board, re-engineered phone or
        other embedded or otherwise interesting hardware project.</p>
        
        <h3>More coming soon</h3>
        <p>Many more workshops will be announced in the run up to the
        conference. Workshop submissions are still open so please
        submit your ideas for workshops you would like to see or even
        organise.</p>
        
        <h2>Talks</h2>
        <p>Obviously it is a bit too early in the conference cycle to
        have this year's talks, but they will be shown here as they
          are accepted and entered into the schedule.</p>
        <p>Talk submissions are still open, so submit your talk title
        and short abstract now!</p>
