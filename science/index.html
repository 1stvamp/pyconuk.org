            <p>If you are a working scientist then this track is for you -- whether you have never used Python before and want to dip your toe in the water, or you are a fully-fledged Pythonista, looking to expand your repertoire. The PyConUK Science Track will offer you three days of learning, collaboration and fun, and a chance to meet other scientists using Python.
            </p>
            <p>The PyConUK Science Track will feature:
                <ul>
                    <li>tutorials on Python suitable for beginner Python programmers where you can learn to automate common data analysis and visualisation tasks</li>
                    <li>talks from other scientists and professional software engineers on Python in science and best practices for developing your own code</li>
                    <li>a collaborative <strong>open science sprint</strong> where you can bring along a task to automate, or a piece of code you want to open source, and we will put you in groups to turn your existing scripts or workflow into an reproducible piece of open science!
                    Watch this space -- there may be prizes :)</li>
